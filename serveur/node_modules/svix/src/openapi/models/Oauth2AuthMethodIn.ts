/**
* The method used for authenticating to the OAuth authorization server.  `clientSecretJwt` will construct a JWT used for authentication with the oauth authorization server. This method is less commonly used and may not be supported by all oauth providers. `clientSecretBasic` will authenticate to the oauth authorization server using an `Authorization` header with the client secret as the value. This is the most common means of authentication. `clientSecretPost` will authenticate to the oauth authorization server by passing the client secret in a `client_secret` field in the request body. This method may not be supported by all oauth providers, and in general `clientSecretBasic` should be preferred.
